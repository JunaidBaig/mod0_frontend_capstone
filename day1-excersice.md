1) What is the purpose of HTML code?
HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language, is a standard for describing the structure and presentation of information via the Internet. Web developers use HTML keywords or tags to instruct the Web browser application how to format and display the content of Web pages.

HTML tag is just opening or closing entity. For example:

<p> and </p> are called HTML tags

HTML element encompasses opening tag, closing tag, content (optional for content-less tags) Eg:

<p>This is the content</p> : This complete thing is called a HTML element

3) Why do we use attributes in HTML element?

HTML attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.

4) Describe the purpose of Head, title and body HTML element?

The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag. ... Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
